This directory contains all the files related to DCE-RPC protocol
processing.

DCE is supported over TCP/IP, UDP, SMB and HTTP v1 Proxy and Server.
The DCE-RPC preprocessor is split into four inspectors - one for each
transport. This includes the configuration as well as the inspector
modules.

The inspectors perform SMB desegmentation and DCE-RPC defragmentation
to avoid rule evasion using these techniques. IPS rule options are
supported for matching on interface, opnum and stub data.

The Snort 2x server configuration is now split between the inspectors.
Options that are meaningful to all inspectors, such as policy, are
copied into each inspector configuration.

The address/port mapping is handled by the binder. Autodetect
functionality is replaced by wizard curses.

The Snort 2x global configuration is now rolled into server
configuration.
