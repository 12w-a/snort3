The HTTP/2 inspector (H2I) will convert HTTP/2 frames into HTTP/1.1 message sections and feed them
to the new HTTP inspector (NHI) for further processing.

The current implementation is the very first step. It splits an HTTP/2 stream into frame sections and
forwards them for inspection. It does not interface with NHI and does not address the multiplexed
nature of HTTP/2.

The Http2StreamSplitter strips the frame headers from the frame data and stores them in separate
buffers. As in NHI, long data frames are split into 16kb chunks for inspection. If a header frame is
followed by continuation frames, all the header frames are flushed together for inspection. The
frame headers from each frame are stored contiguously in the frame_header buffer. After cutting out
the frame headers, the frame data is stored as a single block, consisting of the HPACK encoded
HTTP/2 headers. HPACK decoding is under ongoing development. Decoded headers will be stored in the
http2_decoded_header buffer.
