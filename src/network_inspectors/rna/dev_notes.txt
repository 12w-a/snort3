This inspector is still in experimental (work-in-progress) state.

The Real-time Network Awareness (RNA) inspector provides visibility into
a network using Passive Network Discovery (PND). RNA analyzes traffic
to discover hosts on the network, and detect operating systems, protocols and
applications running on these hosts. It does not generate or alter traffic on its own.

RNA generates events for the information it discovers by parsing
TCP/UDP/IP/Link-layer protocols and analyzing data found by other
inspectors (e.g., monitoring application IDs, client versions, user-agents from stash).
Operating systems have different signatures which are apparent in different parameters
in the packets that it sends. These parameters include things like TCP window sizes,
TCP options, segment sizes, etc. Such fingerprinting information is provided to RNA
as input so that RNA can analyze traffic.

RNA discoveries will be stored globally in host_tracker objects and to be shared among
multiple threads. RNA memory and discovery are bounded by the memcap in host_tracker.

Packets from untracked sessions (e.g., non-IP) are processed via the eval method as per
proto-bit registrations. Packets from tracked sessions (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP)
are processed via events as per subscriptions. Since RNA needs to see the first packet
of a session published from stream trackers, these modules (e.g., stream, stream_ip,
stream_tcp, and stream_udp) should be enabled whenever RNA module is enabled.
